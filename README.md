Osmo Supply Clone
A clone of Osmo Supply using Angular, Next.js, and JavaScript, with a Video Call Feature powered by WebRTC and Socket.io. The frontend uses Angular for dashboards and Next.js for SSR, while the backend runs on Node.js & Express with MySQL (Planetscale). To set up, install dependencies and run ng serve for Angular and npm run dev for Next.js. The video call feature enables real-time communication with low latency. Contributions are welcome!
